## Preface
Jim and Tom are two friends that have decided to start a blog.  
Jim is always full of ideas and involved Tom, who is a programmer always too busy, in the realization of this personal project.   

## Version 0

Tom wanted to help his friend, but having little time, he left the project unfinished.  
Jim was not discouraged, however, and with one of his ideas he found a way to carry on the project: searching on the web he found you and asked you for help for his blog. He knows that you are not an expert programmer, but with some Tom's indications about how to proceed there will be no problem!  

The code of the project is very structured, but it has few features yet. It is ready for testing, but the current ones doesn't make much sense, but they are in any case an excellent basis for creating new ones.
