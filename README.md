## Description
_Learn by Doing_ is a project to teach *web programming*.  
A series of repositories will be created to encourage *learning by doing*.  
From time to time activities will be proposed as if they were *real work tasks* commissioned by customers.  
The activities will be divided into categories (database, frontend and backend) to allow you to discover your *programming interests and talents*.  

## How to use learn-by-doing
If you want to use the repositories these are the tips to do it in the best way:  
- Choose a project from the [list of projects](#list-of-projects) by reading the *Preface* and the *Instructions* in the <span>README</span>.md file of the specific project  
- Fork the repository of choosen project to your github account  
- Read the proposed features to implement and get started! The features are proposed with these elements:
    - A description of the context (characterized by a credible history)  
    - The type of activity that will take place is indicated in square brackets (database, backend and frontend - you can choose to follow only those of your interest and [skip](#do-some-exercises-skipping-the-previous-ones the previous ones)  
    - In a separate file the *Implementation specifications* are indicated, you will be shown step by step all the activities to be done to implement the functionality  
        - At the bottom of the text there will be a link to the branch of the repository where the functionality was completed - this if you need further help to overcome the problems encountered and to compare your solution with the one proposed by the creation of the exercise  
    - The *Learning objectives* are indicated in a separate file, you will need them to know what you have learned/practiced.

## How to contribute to the learn-by-doing project
The _learn-by-doing_ project is designed especially for those who want to learn to program and want to "apply in the field" the knowledge they already have as if they were in a working context.  
It can also be used by those who already have experience as a *format* for learning and exercising others.  
In this case you can fork the *learn-by-doing* repository and use existing projects (or create new ones) and thus make this possibility available to others.  

## How to ...

### Do some exercises skipping the previous ones
If you are not interested in all the steps to implement the functionality and you want to practice only a certain activity of the exercise (for example only the frontend) and you do not want or cannot carry out the previous exercises (which however are prerequisites) you can access the branch with the exercise performed and download the previous commit to the one you want to accomplish.
